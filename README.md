# Image-Captioning-Using-RNN
Aim of the project is to create CNN-RNN network capable of producing caption for the input images

# Instructions  
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi  
```
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git  
```

2. Setup the coco API (also described in the readme [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi)) 
```
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI  
make  
cd ..
```

3. Download some specific data from here: http://cocodataset.org/#download (described below)


4. The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order (`0_Dataset.ipynb, 1_Preliminaries.ipynb, 2_Training.ipynb, 3_Inference.ipynb`).
